<p>The core libraries are now done (or so I thought), so I'm slowly refactoring the game libraries, one component at a time. But because nothing escapes my refactoring extravaganza, I discovered another victim in the core libraries, ready to be refactored mercilessly: the grid/graph pathfinding. So, my original idea is to make the pathfinders objects that keep some state and run one iteration at a time, as I envisioned that I might interrupt an A* calculation halfway through. Well, thinking about it, that's nonsense, so ... refactor away.</p>
<p>Now the pathfinding routine is just a function with 3 arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>config </strong>struct which, as the name implies, provides configuration/setup for the search execution: start point, goals, heuristics, search space etc.</li>
<li>A <strong>state </strong>struct which maintains the algorithm state: fscore/gscore maps, the priority queue, etc.</li>
<li>An <strong>output</strong> struct which stores the output from the search, such as the path, path costs (optional), visited nodes (optional), etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>To aid debugging, I've added a conditionally compiled part that <strong>records state and output at every search iteration. </strong>After this semantic separation in these structures, recording the state is now a breeze! I just keep a vector of states/outputs per iteration to see their "history" and how they evolve.</p>
<p>So, with the nicely modularized grid pathfinder function and the newly refactored rendering system, we can implement an application that visualizes pathfinding (inspired by <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html">Amit's super awesome A* page</a>, among others). I've made an application that uses ImGui and my widgets (the tilegrid one to be precise), so that I can dynamically modify weights on the map, as well as start and goals, heuristics, 4 or 8 connectivity, etc. Additionally, several visualization options are provided as overlays: visited cells, gscore, fscore, the calculated path, start/end points, etc, all as layers: gscore, fscore and weights exist for all cells, so they are rendered using a dense tile renderer, while start, goals, visited cells are rendered using a sparse tile renderer. The tilegrid widget uses a group renderer, tha renders all the layers specified. Way too much text and way too little action, here's a video capture of the visualizer:</p>

<p>Next thing to do is make sure the graph pathfinder works well, and then continue the refactoring quest, which is totally worth it.</p>
