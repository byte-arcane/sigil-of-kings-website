<p>A bunch of things this week, mainly bug fixing, which I&#39;m not going to focus on, so I&#39;ll keep it short. </p>
<ul>
<li>Remember that statue pushing last week? Well this time I implemented a proper &quot;creature ability&quot; to push or pull. Character moves with the object. Thankfully that was quite easy to implement.</li>
<li>At some point I need to start building executables to distribute for testing various bits. Last time I attempted that was several months ago while porting. Tried it again, fixed a bunch of issues (and a few remain), but looks like it&#39;s going to be fine.</li>
<li>Fireball and other AoE damage effects should destroy cobwebs and other such objects. </li>
<li>Solved a few more issues related to doors! We all know how doors are PITA :) Examples, also specific to my implementation/visuals:<ul>
<li>if a secret door is opened (by some monster -- should not happen!), reveal it first, otherwise there&#39;s a graphical glitch</li>
<li>if a door is secret, creatures should not open it (spoils the fun)</li>
<li>if a door is locked, creatures should not open it from the other side (players can though)</li>
<li>when unlocking a wooden door, the sprite was changed to the metal one. I was missing sprites, but fixed all that</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Swapping is allowed automatically with neutral creatures. Previously you could swap with friendly creatures only, but it was tedious when encountering neutral creatures in corridors that you didn&#39;t want to kill. Also I removed the GUI that allowed you to swap or attack, and now you swap automatically. You can still attack creatures with an explicit action.</li>
<li>A little bit of GUI work. This means just slowly following a tutorial really, but I paused that for bug fixing. Will resume!</li>
</ul>
<p>More things in the pipeline for next time, so next week&#39;s forecast is fonts, attack animation and GUI. </p>
