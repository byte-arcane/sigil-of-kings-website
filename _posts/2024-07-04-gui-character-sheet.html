<p>Yet another GUI week, this time the <strong>character sheet</strong>! It is supposed to provide a detailed overview of the character. I have split it into 5 sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview</strong>: this shows a quick summary of the character: name, age, level, hp/mp/xp, factions they&#39;ve joined, traits they have, a portrait later on, etc. </li>
<li><strong>Active Effects</strong>: this shows effects that are currently applied to the character. An obvious one is status effects, that are shown as a list of status icons with a &quot;status level&quot; overlay on each icon. Under this, we have a potentially nightmarish amount of effects (that I&#39;m not currently showing because of lack of good representation) relevant to the character: 1) character effects by e.g. drinking a potion or a fountain, or casting a buff or getting a debuff 2) equipment effects from items that are currently equipped. I thought it&#39;s nice to have all the effects presented in one place, and probably in the future this section will get far more love, to display it nicely and probably even filter it.</li>
<li><strong>Combat Stats</strong>: these are some derived combat values, like attack/defence rating and resistances (flat or percent) to various types of damage.</li>
<li><strong>Attributes</strong>: Our character&#39;s attributes. In the case of available points to spend, there are +/- buttons that appear, including an &quot;Apply&quot; and &quot;Reset&quot; button to register/cancel changes</li>
<li><strong>Skills</strong>: Our character&#39;s skills. Presented similarly to attributes (inc buttons), although it&#39;s a far longer list. In the future each skill&#39;s mastery level needs to be presented better, because they act as milestones and limiters for skill values.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#39;s it mainly! It involved plenty of icon hunting (from <a href="https://game-icons.net/">here</a>), some icon pre-processing, some GUI button design and generally GUI-related work and semi-relevant bug-fixes.
Yet another incoming week away from my desk, so I need to figure out something useful to do with my aging laptop.</p>
