<p>Last few weeks were work on lighting. But not just pretty-pixel-art lighting, but <strong>lighting for gameplay purposes</strong>. So far, light was mostly a visual effect via <a href="https://byte-arcane.github.io/age-of-transcendence/2020/05/22/weather-and-performance/">time-of-day-lighting</a> and by representation of the 3 visibility states: currently seen (100% brightness), unseen but previously-explored (40% brightness), and never-seen (black).</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, this is not enough. Here are some examples where a more well-developed lighting solution could be utilised:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stealth</strong>. Light is essential for stealth. Low light is advantageous when trying to move undetected, unless enemies see well in the dark</li>
<li><strong>Light puzzles</strong>. Some doors/chests might be opened only with the presence of certain amount of light (e.g very high or very low)</li>
<li><strong>Status effects</strong>. Creatures can be blinded, by bright light.</li>
<li><strong>Creature traits</strong>. Some creatures can see in the dark, and don't get any penalties from low light</li>
<li><strong>Field of view</strong>. Creatures might be able to see further in good (for them) light conditions</li>
<li><strong>Combat effects</strong>. To-hit chances might be lower in undesirable light situations, e.g. a cave dweller in bright light or a regular creature at very low light</li>
<li><strong>Spells, wall torches, movable objects</strong>. To control the level of light in various ways.</li>
</ul>
<p>To enable the above I need some way of simulating light in a way that I have access to from the gameplay code, rather than it being just a visual effect. To do that, I'm using a simple lighting "model", which seems to be working pretty well. The light model is comprised of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Light exists at a tile, between 0 (full darkness) and 1 (very bright).</li>
<li>Each zone (level or sublevel) can specify a "ambient" light level, which is the light level without any other light sources around. For example, outdoors would be 1 and a dungeon/cavern could be 0.5.</li>
<li>Light sources emit light in all directions, which reduces linearly</li>
<li>Light is additive: a light source's light gets added to the ambient light.</li>
<li>Light bleeding: at the borders between zones, light can bleed from the brighter one to the darker one</li>
<li>Light propagates via Dijkstra maps, using the light source(s) as goals and the weights for intensities. If the brightness of a lightsource is 0.7, the goal is set to a weight of -0.7, and I gather all grid cells whose weight is &lt;= 0, and use the "-weight" as the brightness. The light decay rate (how much brightness is lost from a tile to a neighbouring one) is set to a low value, I'm using 0.07.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, that's about it. I'm running these calculations in the native plugin and they're pretty fast.So, to best test the system, I added torches and braziers. Torches exist on dungeon walls, braziers are actual objects (and probably movable, although heavy). I've added procedural placement of torches in the dungeon walls so I don't have to worry about placing them, and it works fine.</p>

<p>I've iterated a few times on the look of lighting, fog of war, weather and time-of-day color grading. After some useful feedback <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/nxj59c/fog_of_war_and_dynamic_lighting/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/o33p17/sharing_saturday_367/h29qhsh/">here</a>, I've opted for a faded sepia for areas that the player can't actively see but has explored, whereas the brightness remains the same. Time-of-day affects brightness, and colour: Ambient light get tinted with time-of-day color grading (e.g. blue-ish at night) whereas light sources provide untinted brightness. <a href="https://youtu.be/M73nxWlP4Xc?t=35">This is shown here. Compare with the earlier videos below</a></p>

<p>Finally, I've been experimenting with a different look for fog-of-war in the overworld (as shown at the first video), although it's still a bit too gray for my taste. Now that the light infrastructure is there, onwards to other things, and possibly some usual maintainance/refactoring which follows feature additions.</p>
