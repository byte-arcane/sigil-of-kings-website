<p>More work on procedural placement of things this week, plus some refactor, although I was quite distracted by Diablo IV open beta during the weekend (good distraction!)</p>
<p><strong>Altar areas</strong></p>
<p>Altar area specification is rather simple. It&#39;s a small 9x9 empty area (blobby shape) with an altar in the middle, the occasional bones/blood and statues, placed in one of several patterns, around it. There&#39;s not much more to be said, and it works as intended! Later on, variations will be created, for abandoned altars, altars with a cult around, and so on.</p>

<p><strong>Mines</strong></p>
<p>One of the map archetypes that I want to have is mines. Precious metals are a thing in Sigil of Kings and can be used to improve a city&#39;s wealth and to construct equipment from them, with special properties. So, naturally, there should be mines and adventures related to mines. And what is a characteristic of a map in a mine? Mine cart rails of course! This was an excuse to write an algorithm to calculate the track tiles, which was not more complicated than using the walkable areas as a binary mask and run a skeletonization process. The final result was connected just along the diagonals and was a bit too excessive, so I had to make a few edits to make it a bit better looking. The result is not too bad I think! It&#39;s going to be more challenging to create the art for autotiled tracks, even if it&#39;s really 2 tiles (straight and 90 degree turn) with overlays/reflections/rotations.</p>

<p><strong>Misc</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I just found an excuse to use std::variant for generic dictionaries and I quite like it! Previously, prefab placement algorithms had custom state which was stored as a class hierarchy, but now the state data are just stored as a variant dictionary.</li>
<li>I&#39;ve been doing a lot of thinking about how the prefab placement code can be used later on to augment existing placement algorithms with quest-specific information. I&#39;ve settled currently that the placement element name (reminder: a procedural placement configuration generates a number of named elements, each specifying algorithm and properties) will be used as a lookup in C# to instantiate whatever it needs however it needs. For example, for some quest to slay the legendary beast &quot;Blood Fang&quot;, I&#39;ll be instantiating a &quot;Beast Cave&quot; and I instantiate for the &quot;beast&quot; element the &quot;Blood Fang&quot; creature.</li>
</ul>
