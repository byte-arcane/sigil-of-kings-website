<p>Still refactoring/expending the ability system, as I&#39;m trying to add some challenging cases that play well with the other abstractions. Being sick for several days certainly did not help. Managed to add two example skills, a variation of &quot;Charge&quot; that can target a wall tile and breaks it, and a variation of the Lasso skill which can select an object or a creature and hurls it towards another object/creature/tile, which can cause some knockback as well. This involved some bug-fixing in the animation order/delay system, and the creation of a shader that renders a bezier-powered lasso for the hurling animation. I&#39;m quite happy with how it looks overall.</p>
