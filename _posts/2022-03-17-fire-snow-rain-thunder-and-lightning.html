<p>More effects work this week, as I thought I&#39;d revisit fire, rain and snow. Snow looked <a href="https://twitter.com/ByteArcane/status/1426516200394166275?s=20&amp;t=4OVAiFTccbBHtCgZNCCllA">ultra bad</a>, rain was ok but the splashes were annoying. <a href="https://twitter.com/ByteArcane/status/1495005251216162819?s=20&amp;t=4OVAiFTccbBHtCgZNCCllA">Fire was not &quot;fluid&quot; enough</a> as it was a 2-frame animation. As again I could use such effects for trailer material, I needed to revisit, and not spend too long on it. </p>
<p><strong>Fire</strong></p>
<p>This is now using <a href="https://brullov.itch.io/fire-animation">brullov</a>&#39;s sprites, which I think fits nicely with the style; not perfect, but much better. New fire video below, in the form of a &quot;fire nova&quot; effect, where flames expand radially to all tiles until a specified radius, blocked by anything that blocks visibility. It&#39;s using a new &quot;wave&quot; particle system that sorts tiles that particles are spawned, and spawns particles there delayed according to distance. </p>

<p><strong>Snow</strong></p>
<p>I got rid of my old particle system and horrible sprite, and I&#39;ve added something super-simple and tweaked the fall to be slightly different. I think it looks better now: new (below) vs <a href="https://twitter.com/ByteArcane/status/1426516200394166275?s=20&amp;t=4OVAiFTccbBHtCgZNCCllA">old</a>. It&#39;s still super simple and not configurable in terms of heavy snowfall, wind speed etc, but those don&#39;t really matter much, for now.</p>
<p><strong>Rain and thunder</strong></p>

<p>Rain was ok, but the splashes were horrible. Can&#39;t find an old video to show you, but new version video is below, and <strong>sound on</strong> please. Rain drops are now vertical and splashes are much better, courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP8zj-JQgmI">GreenMask Games</a>. Also, inspired by another dev, I decided to add thunder and lightning. This happens only during rain in warmer climates, and it&#39;s a short flash including a booming sound. The effect of the flash is to heavily increase contrast, as a poor-man&#39;s HDR effect, where because of the bright light (from the strike) and our eyes trying to accomodate to it, the darker areas become pitch black. In practice, it&#39;s like a sigmoid applied to the brightness of the image. </p>
