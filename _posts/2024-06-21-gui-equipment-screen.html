<p>Unsurprisingly, more UI this week! In addition to some bug smashing and some other random bits.</p>
<p><strong>Equipment UI</strong></p>
<p>Since the basic game UI view is up and running, now it&#39;s the time to start implementing some other &quot;adjacent&quot; screens. The one this week is equipment, and the one that&#39;s coming next week is the inventory. The approach taken is simplicity and compatibility with gamepad navigation (and obviously also mouse and keyboard, but that&#39;s a given). </p>
<p>The features are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equipment slots are in a vertical list</li>
<li>Each slot contains the slot icon, the equipment name and the equipment icon</li>
<li>Each slot is clickable, which brings another context menu with compatible equipment options for that slot</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&#39;s it really! Quite simple for now, but works as intended. Due to some limitations, the moment you replace a piece of equipment, the equipment screen and context menu dissapear and game time passes. On the plus side, it&#39;s clear this way that time passes, so better be careful :)</p>
<p>A bit of a shame that you can&#39;t see the player sprite becoming visually different while you&#39;re changing equipment, but since it doesn&#39;t affect gameplay I thought it doesn&#39;t make much sense to show an overblown 24x24 sprite changing looks, plus it would probably happen after the end of the action (= game time passing).</p>
<p><strong>C# 12</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pkdawson/imgui-godot">Dear ImGUI for Godot</a> addon had a recent big release, so I thought I&#39;d better update it, and got some errors. Because... it required C# 12! Ok, so that&#39;s a thing now? I&#39;m clearly a bit behind. After setting up the project to now use C# 12, I got a couple of compile errors in my code regarding ... BinaryFormatter. So, it&#39;s done: BinaryFormatter is officially very much ousted. The error was from some forgotten bit of unused code, so after removing it, I pat myself on the back for changing to <a href="https://github.com/Cysharp/MemoryPack">MemoryPack</a>, and continued on other work. Bye bye BinaryFormatter, you were damn convenient though. Oh, and I guess I need to check if there&#39;s any new neat thing with C# 12, but eyeballing the features quickly, nothing stood out.</p>
<p>Also, currently on holidays, so next update is going to be lite!</p>
