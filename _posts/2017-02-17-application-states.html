<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>Application states are simply the states an application can be in. A rough definition would be: a state is the set of data and logic that is responsible for <strong>handling input</strong>, and <strong>displaying output</strong> at any given time. State examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Main menu</li>
<li>Options</li>
<li>Credits</li>
<li>Overworld</li>
<li>Dungeon</li>
<li>Selecting a single target tile</li>
<li>Selecting a single target entity ( several entities can lie on a tile, e.g. items on the floor, a creature and a trap)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Another name would be "game stack", "game states" and so on. Of course these can all have several other meanings depending on who you talk to, but that's irrelevant)</p>
<h2>Desirable traits</h2>
<ul>
<li>Active state stack
<ul>
<li>Top of the stack is running, others are paused</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>State hierarchy
<ul>
<li>A state can be a state machine. For example, a state of "select 5 targets" can be a state machine which 5 transitions of type select_target</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Arbitrary data exchange between states
<ul>
<li>States have a <em>blackboard</em> of sorts ( a flat collection of map&lt; string , type&gt;, one per type ) that can store data used to communicate to parent/child states</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Configurable via JSON
<ul>
<li>Should be able to define states and state machines, complete with transfers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>System design</h2>
<p>There are two main actors in this system: the <strong>Application State Manager</strong> and the <strong>Application State. </strong>The public interface related to transitions should be very simple.</p>
<p>The <strong>manager</strong> is responsible for creating states, providing the current active state and execute one of the three transition operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Push(state, next_state, transfer_request) : </strong>Pauses the state, pushes next_state to the stack and starts next_state. When next_state <strong>finishes</strong> successfully, it will use the transfer_request to transfer data to state.</li>
<li><strong>Finish(state, success) : </strong>Stops the state, marking the state execution as successful or not</li>
<li><strong>SwitchTo( state, next_state) : </strong>A convenience function for finishing a state successfully and starting another state</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>States</strong> own a root widget and a blackboard. States can do their custom input handling and rendering in addition to the widgets (done before/after or completely ignoring the widget-related functionality)</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>I used the above concepts to create a simple example, which is demonstrated in the below video.  We have 5 states:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menu:</strong> Start the application at this state. It has it's own gui with two buttons: Play and Quit. Play button leads to "Loading" state. Quit quits the application</li>
<li><strong>Loading: </strong>This state shows a gui with a timer - after 1 second the state is switched to "Game"</li>
<li><strong>Game: </strong>This state has again its own gui, and shows a map with a playable lich character, which can be moved with the arrow keys. 'L' key changes the state to "TargetSingleTile", while 'T' key changes state to "TargetMultiTile"</li>
<li><strong>TargetSingleTile: </strong>This state does not have its own gui - it uses whatever gui was there before. It adds a selection of highlighted tiles, centered at the character. When the user clicks on a tile that is within the selection, the state completes successfully and transfers the selected tile to the parent. At the tile, a skeleton appears.</li>
<li><strong>TargetMultiTile: </strong>This state doesn't have its own gui either. It is a state machine, and calls TargetSingleTile successively. When the state machine is finished, the locations of all selected tiles are sent to the parent state (Game). At those tiles, wraiths appear</li>
</ul>

<p>The system is still a bit rough around the edges, and it looks like it can be converted to a generic state machine (which I could reuse perhaps for some basic AI), but it's ok for now.</p>
