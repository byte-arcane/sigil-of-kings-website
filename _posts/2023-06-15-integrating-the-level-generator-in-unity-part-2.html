<p>More miscellaneous updates this week, all revolving around bug-fixing and expanding the level generation process and the integration with the native plugin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some bugs related to level/zone name generation (zones are areas in a level). Zone names for example are not very useful for the player to know, but for debugging it&#39;s great to hover over a tile and know what zone it belongs to, e.g. &quot;crypt&quot;. </li>
<li>Changed a bit how tags and weights work. Besides being used for plain requirements (&quot;must be have haunted tag&quot;, &quot;must not have abandoned tag&quot;), we can associate weights with tags that can be added to some base weight. Example: torches would specify a -0.5 weight for the tag &quot;dark&quot;, so dark zones would spawn fewer torches than they normally would</li>
<li>I tried to use a separate Unity script to see if I can make dynamic changes to the C# script while the game is running, but if I make a change and the code recompiles, everything breaks. Hmmm, there goes this approach of &quot;hot reload&quot;, need to try a few more.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where torches were not spawning</li>
<li>Rewrote lighting algorithm as it was a bit dumb: it was using multi-goal Dijkstra to get contribution from multiple light sources, but that created a few issues, one of which is that lights next to each other were not additive. So I&#39;ve put my super-fast FoV code to do the work (&quot;for every tile in the radius of a lightsource, test visibility&quot;) and so far so good with lots of torches (relatively small radius each)</li>
<li>Fixed torches having the wrong sprite, this was due to some badly configured JSON which annoyed me so much that I started ...</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Great JSON purge</strong></p>
<p>JSON (mis)configurations were a bit hard to detect as I have to maintain C++ &lt;-&gt; JSON &lt;-&gt; C# . So, if I change a field in C# and I don&#39;t fix all the corresponding JSON configurations, I get insidious bugs. So I decided I&#39;ll go a bit more robust about it. A few things fixed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added detection of entries in JSON that do not exist in C# variables. That was a big one, and catches a lot of problems. After I implemented that, it flagged lots of errors in 18 separate JSON files (out of 52). That&#39;s a lot. Overall fixed several classes of errors:<ul>
<li>json key was old and had been changed in c#</li>
<li>misplaced key (e.g. in parent object)</li>
<li>json key only read in C++ plugin and not in C#</li>
<li>C# config classes had some variables that I had decided to remove</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Duplicate detection in JSON. Before I did have a JSON validator script, but now it&#39;s also checking for duplicates, that are allowed but problematic of course.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Inheritable properties</strong></p>
<p>After the JSON purge, I also ended up in another rabbit hole: I have a hierarchical zone relationship, and each zone may or may not have certain settings, e.g. floor type, wall/blocked type, dominant biome, difficulty, tags, etc. I might have values, or I might want to say &quot;inherit from parent&quot;. So I did another round of refactoring in both C#/C++ adding support for several zone properties to allow inheritance. Dust is settled on that department for now, and it looks far more reasonable. </p>
<p><strong>Other changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added support in C# for procedural selection of optional zones, so e.g. prisons may appear in dungeons, altar areas or lean-tos in the wilderness, etc</li>
<li>Added support for things like being able to easily specify a wizard tower adventure location in JSON by declaring 1) it&#39;s dungeon-style 2) has round shaped levels 3) Further levels go up instead of down 4) levels don&#39;t change size (or slightly shrink) as we&#39;re going up. My holy grail is to easily specify complex dungeons from JSON or simple C# scripting. At the moment I can do exclusively either &quot;easily&quot; or &quot;complex&quot;.</li>
<li>Added support with a bool to make a coastal map (a map that in the overworld has border with a big body of water) an island or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#39;s all for now, next week on holidays so it&#39;s going to get slow for a couple of weeks. Have a nice weekend!</p>
