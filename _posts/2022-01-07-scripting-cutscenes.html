<p>While watching random indie work on Twitter, I was reminded that it would be cool to support cutscenes. Now, cutscenes are not the most important part of gamedev, but it&#39;s something that I definitely envision for the game to have. They are also very presentable, and I&#39;m currently in the mood for them, and I have lots of the underlying supporting code fresh in my head, so ... Why Not? </p>
<p>What are the basic ingredients of a cutscene? </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Characters talking.</strong> E.g. the player enters a level, and notices that it&#39;s remarkably cold, or that there&#39;s an eerie silence. This can really add to the atmosphere. Or, if a boss is encountered (who is intelligent and can speak), some &quot;discussion&quot; could happen.</li>
<li><strong>Camera work.</strong> At its most basic form, camera <em>moves</em> to focus on characters who are talking, or objects, or anything else.</li>
<li><strong>Characters doing things.</strong> For example, moving, attacking, shooting fireballs, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Environment effects. </strong> Rain starts, some explosion happens somewhere, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the above, how can a cutscene be implemented? Well, I had something very important in place, which is a developer console that can execute commands. Now the trick is to be able to support all commands that could be used in a cutscene. Here are a few that I have implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>cam_move [position]</strong> Moves camera to desired position</li>
<li><strong>aa [aa_name] [target] [args...]</strong> Executes an active ability (e.g. move, attack etc) for the given target entity (e.g. player, monster) with the given arguments. This was slightly tricky as a simple string needs to be converted to a fully parameterized command, but I had 70% of that done anyway.</li>
<li><strong>screenshake [duration]</strong> Executes screenshake for the given duration</li>
<li><strong>text [text] [position]</strong> Creates a text bubble at the given position (e.g. position of player character)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, given these, the only thing extra needed in order to implement cutscenes is to be able to schedule these: execute command, wait a bit, execute another command, wait a bit more, etc. So that&#39;s just another simple class that stores a list of commands and real-time delay between each command. Now, in order to execute the cutscene, we execute a coroutine that goes through each command, executes the command, and yields by waiting for the given amount of delay. And that&#39;s it! To add an extra bit of polish and sensibility, while the commands are executing we need to completely disable input, except a single key (e.g. Escape) that breaks the loop, thus skipping the cutscene. Below is an example video that uses just the above commands, and below that is the cutscene script.</p>

<p><strong>Misc updates</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ve been lazy with blog post updates due to friction in creating blog posts, which is currently done using jekyll and manually creating html files. To reduce friction, I wrote a script which, given a few parameters (date, title, representative video, etc) can create a post template, which reduces the friction. I&#39;d love a simple offline wysiwyg editor for jekyll, but all I&#39;ve seen is some cloud-based need-an-account yada yada solutions, which again increase friction, or jekyll-admin which is not good enough imo.</p>
