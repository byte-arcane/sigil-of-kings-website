<p>So, at the moment the serialization works and the game starts in debug in a few seconds, loading lots of stuff from disk. Territories, routes, cities, etc are all pre-created and serialized in. What's next? The overworld-level play, in the beginning played at a coarse-simulation level by NPCs. This should be fun. So, it goes as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate every so often adventure locations (uncovered tombs, unearthed creatures in mines, dungeons, bandit camps, you name it)</li>
<li>Cities and guilds occasionally give quests</li>
<li>Heroes can accept quests and travel to locations, and succeed or die trying.
<ul>
<li>Overworld travel applies some coarse simulation based on level, skills, biome, chances of ambush, etc</li>
<li>Dungeon clearing applies some coarse simulation based on level, skills and dungeon traits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Heroes can join other heroes and form parties</li>
<li>I can watch them play and die, eating popcorn</li>
<li>Filter the logs to track individual heroes and parties</li>
</ul>
<p>What becomes apparent from the above is the need for everything in the title: parties, quests, adventure locations, levels, stats and skills. This is fun stuff, and very very prone to change, but we need to start from somewhere. For quests and adventure locations I have a few books full of good ideas (<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjtkZyb6t3dAhVsJMAKHf6IAZkQFjABegQIBhAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffroggodgames.com%2Ffrogs%2Fproduct%2Ftome-of-adventure-design-2%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw38icgz3cENCd_brN-ch7Ls">Tome of Adventure Design</a>, <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/63106/Ultimate-Toolbox">Ultimate Toolbox</a>, <a href="http://slyflourish.com/fantasticlocations/">Sly Flourish's Fantastic Locations</a>), so they will be utilized. For stats and skills, I like DnD but I also like some cRPG systems, like Might and MagicÂ series (especially the skill mastery levels and how you need to find trainers to advance a tier). Further posts will target and expand on these subjects</p>
