<p>So, now that simulations now run acceptably, we need to move on from simulations to (well, simulated) reality. There's a still big list of todos:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement turn system (I have an older implementation, so it's not completely from scratch, maybe)</li>
<li>World occasionally generates adventure locations (dungeons)
<ul>
<li>Nearby cities could spread rumours about them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Basic city-related AI
<ul>
<li>City occasionally spawns quests (think town hall bulletin, paid work)</li>
<li>Factions occasionally spawn quests (guild advancement)</li>
<li>Inns occasionally spawn rumours (quests with great rewards that might or might not be true - still thinking about this)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Basic NPC AI
<ul>
<li>Actions in a city...
<ul>
<li>Buy rations</li>
<li>[?] Rest/heal. But maybe that will be automatic</li>
<li>Check city/faction/inn quests.</li>
<li>Meet up people at an inn and form parties</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Actions in a dungeon...
<ul>
<li>Progress with an encounter</li>
<li>Flee</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Actions in the wilderness...
<ul>
<li>Move towards destination (be it a city, a dungeon or an NPC/party)
<ul>
<li>(hmm maybe I need to consider party vs party fight simulation)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Actions anywhere...
<ul>
<li>Set destination (dungeon, city, party, etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decision making
<ul>
<li>Estimate quest difficulty (expected survival. Also try to see what skills are required and compare to own skills)</li>
<li>Estimate quest importance (based on personality and goals. Rogues like gold, Paladins like righteous stuff, etc)</li>
<li>Estimate if enough rations for a quest can be purchased</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ability to track particular NPCs/parties (in terms of location in world map and logging)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The turn/time system will be the first in the list, as actions and AI all utilize the concept of time</p>
