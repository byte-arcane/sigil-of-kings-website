<p>More work the prefab tool this week. I have some preset layouts on which I can try and apply any prefabs. In that video I&#39;m selecting some cavern area preset and I&#39;m applying a prefab that puts a rectangular carpet, statues along its longest axis and a throne away from the entrance. I can regenerate layout, connections or prefab placement with a key, so I can quickly see behaviour in different cases, that&#39;s shown in the video. So far so good, placement algorithm is demonstrated to work on a number of simplistic layouts (rectangular room, rectangular cave), so what&#39;s next?</p>
<p><strong>End goal of prefab system</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes I miss the forest for the trees, as I like delving at low level algorithms, so ... why am I making the prefab system again? And how many procedural systems do I have? So ...</p>
<ul>
<li>Procedural layout generator (water/wall/floor/connections)<ul>
<li>supports a fixed layout &quot;prefab&quot; generator</li>
<li>supports embedding generators inside other generators, as &quot;zones&quot; (zones are thematic areas)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Optional procedural placement of &quot;features&quot; in an entire zone. Features are more generic elements, like &quot;trap&quot;/&quot;encounter&quot;/&quot;treasure&quot;, but can also be specific like &quot;fountain&quot;.</li>
<li>Optional explicit placement of exact elements in a zone (e.g. a particular creature, etc). </li>
<li>Any procedural layout generator that supports &quot;rooms&quot; (e.g. a basic dungeon), also supports room prefabs: pregenerated fixed rooms with fixed dimensions and content</li>
<li>Now I&#39;m adding support for procedural prefabs in given areas (zones or rooms), which is a different algorithmic approach to the &quot;features&quot; approach above.</li>
</ul>
<p>If it&#39;s not clear: the above system is messy. I&#39;m effectively creating generators and I&#39;m trying to mix them together. There&#39;s duplication and duct-taping as needed. There are certain elements that are still missing, so I can&#39;t create all the scenarios that I wish, yet. I&#39;m going to list them below, and how I will imagine they&#39;ll fit into the system (with adjustments of the system)</p>
<ul>
<li>Boss lair<ul>
<li>It&#39;s a zone embedded in a level (so, a bigger zone, e.g. a dungeon)</li>
<li>The layout should be procedural (using a layout generator)</li>
<li>The contents should be themed, but procedurally generated (so it should use the procedural prefabs that I&#39;m adding now)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Hunter&#39;s lodge area (see image)<ul>
<li>It&#39;s an open zone embedded in certain wilderness zones, containing a small building/room, a campfire, maybe a crate or two.</li>
<li>The area layout should be procedural, but nothing complex ( open, roughly rectangularly shaped area, with enough space to put all required elements)</li>
<li>The area contents (campfire, crates) should use some special procedural prefab code</li>
<li>The lodge itself should be a sub-zone, using a simple generator, e.g. called HUNTERS_LODGE</li>
<li>The layout of the lodge should be procedural, but possibly as simple as a rectangular room, but it needs to be themed (e.g. wooden)</li>
<li>The contents of the lodge should use some special procedural prefab generator, e.g. some LODGE preset/algorithm that adds a bed, a kitchen, anything else needed for a cabin in the woods.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wolf cave area<ul>
<li>It&#39;s an open zone embedded in certain wilderness zones, containing a small cavernous area, and some skulls near the area entrance</li>
<li>The area layout should be procedural, but nothing complex ( open, roughly rectangularly shaped area, with enough space to put all required elements)</li>
<li>The area contents (skulls) should use some special procedural prefab code</li>
<li>The cave itself should be a sub-zone, using a simple generator, e.g. called BEAST_CAVE</li>
<li>The layout of the cave should be procedural, using a simple cave generator</li>
<li>The contents of the cave should use some special procedural prefab generator that can place skulls, blood and a &quot;beast pack&quot; encounter, which will be evaluated (somehow somehow, in C#) to wolves</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, hopefully you can see the pattern. A part that&#39;s tough is to make the generators ... generic, whereas when we&#39;re evaluating the prefabs, we map those generic results to anything themed that&#39;re required. That&#39;s still heavy WIP. </p>
<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>
<p>After tinkering with the prefab editor and realising that the iteration speed can be superfast (no unity whatsoever), I need to do two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the prefab tool to support any sort of layouts. Any that can be used for level/zone generation. This means reading the same config files that C# reads to be able to generate dungeons, caverns and so on. This is useful for themed procedural placement of specific things (e.g. rows of statues along a carpeted area) in larger-than-a-room areas (or just more complex). </li>
<li>Make another tool to test out interactively the zone embedding. I&#39;ve shown results in the past, but those were generated from some mega loop that created variations. I want something interactive where I can quickly select what zone should be in what zone, and click click generate and visualize many variations of the map. It&#39;s easier than it sounds, if the different zones are specified already as presets and I just say &quot;Make a wilderness that contains a dungeon that contains a temple&quot; using either some simplistic json and re-loading in the app, or using some basic UI</li>
</ul>
