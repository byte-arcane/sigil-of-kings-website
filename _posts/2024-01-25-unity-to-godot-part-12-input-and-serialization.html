<p>Porting work continues this week. Some of the things done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added ambient sounds for mines and cities. Ambience needs some normalization and tinkering.</li>
<li>Tweaked overworld fog of war look, to make it darker, not the drab cement grey.
<li>Added instant teleport support for debugging</li>
<li>Added press-and-hold actions for the overworld: minimap, fast path (Ctrl shows best apparent path to hovered tile, click moves quickly there), creature and object overlays. These were all implemented previously and now handled through the input systems</li>
<li>Added a few coroutines that I had using a <a href="https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1961">MEC port</a></li>
<li>Chopped quite a bit of old code that&#39;s not used anymore due to refactoring or being Unity-specific</li>
<li>Refactored some cache texture builders, e.g. visibility texture, light texture, etc</li>
<li>Got an issue with deep copying, as the library that I now use (<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/DeepCopy">DeepCopy</a>) failed for some reason throwing exceptions, so I reverted to a codepath using BinaryFormatter, got some issues there too but I fixed them. But this highlighted the ticking bomb that is BinaryFormatter.</li>
<li>Got quicksave/quickload to work fine in the overworld</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Serialization: the next frontier</strong></p>
<p>Currently, at loading time, I do more work than I used to, and it got me thinking about saving/loading. I really hope that&#39;s not going to be the &quot;unplanned time sink of the year&quot; this time, but I need to think hard and forward about it. At the moment my saves (BinaryFormatter dumps, with LZ4 applied) are not robust at all - if ANY data structure changes, my entire savefile is obsolete. That&#39;s an issue of course, and I need something more robust. Also quicksave/load need to be quick, so savefiles and save data need to contain some hash info to compare to avoid reload/rewrite. Finally, BinaryFormatter, that I&#39;m using, needs to be refactored out anyway, so I need to do it at some point... Next week&#39;s work (and probably more) will be devoted to serialization.</p>
