<p>So far I've been using (well, typically in a placeholder sort of sense) the typical Dnd alignment, that is the two axes of Law vs Chaos and Good vs Evil. Cities could have an alignment, factions could have an alignment, NPCs could have an alignment. Cities with different alignment might not have the best relations, factions with different alignment to cities would probably not have guild chapters in them, and so on.</p>

<p>The DnD alignment system is crude. Like, very crude. It results in very one-dimensional characters, if used as the <strong>sole</strong> definition of personality. And that's the problem point of cRPGs that utilize such a system: DnD makes you specify an alignment and allows you to roleplay a personality that fuzzily overlaps with that alignment. A paladin must be lawful good, so you can't kick babies or vandalize churches (well, maybe it's ok to smash the altar of an evil god). Recluse paladin? Fine. Social paladin? Maybe, lurking in the Order of the Holier-Than-Thou Chalice. Adventurer paladin? Sure. Always guarding the city? Why not (well, they'd make a dull player character). The point is that DnD gives you a mould (one of 9 alignments) and gives you freedom to role-play within it.</p>

<p>The potential problem comes with mapping such an alignment to a cRPG where there's little role-play involved (well, depends on the amount of dialog options), esp. for encounters with NPCs. Without the dialog, they are simply too one-dimensional. We either assume characters have one of 9 personalities, or we have to accept that per alignment, an NPC could have a variety of personalities, and just conjure one up with our imagination. </p>

<p>In Sigil of Kings, there will be lots of NPCs roaming the world, with different personalities and motivations. The DnD alignment system in this case falls short, and is the reason for me trying to ditch the 9 alignments, rewriting  some code and writing this post. <strong>The DnD alignments do not provide sufficient motive for adventuring. </strong>Why would a chaotic good character go to Tower of Blerps, home to the Gargantual Chargrilled Worm? "Probably because the worm is evil, preferably chaotic" I'd assume without any more info. Or "because it's a Good Deed, and all members of the local community would agree". </p>

<p>So, I've decided to replace DnD alignments with a bastardised version of the <a href="https://www.psychologistworld.com/personality/five-factor-model-big-five-personality">Five-Factor Model of Personality</a>, which is comprised of the following axes:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Curiosity:</strong> Openness to new experiences/cultures/ideas</li>
<li><strong>Discipline: </strong>Being law-abiding, liking order</li>
<li><strong>Social: </strong>Prefer to be with company, outgoing, sociable.</li>
<li><strong>Empathy: </strong>Friendly/sympathetic to others/outsiders</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Compared to DnD, I can crudely map Good/Evil to Empathy and Law/Chaos to Discipline. The others are tangential factors to personality, that can give different motivations for doing things. </p>
