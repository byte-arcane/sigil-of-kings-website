<p>The world (a 512x512 grid, where each cell is a region) contains a few hundred city-states, each with its guilds, shops, local government etc. Each of these city-states has an area of influence, based on their wealth, population, etc. City-states might or might not like each other, but overall there's balance. You are an adventurer, possibly starting as a lowly apprentice in some random little town's local Seeker's guild.</p>

<p>Recently, some adversarial force has been awoken/introduced in the world, which results in city-states to try and contain it or destroy it. This can manifest in a simplified scenario as some fortresses that pop-up, generating their own sphere of influence, and slowly but surely overwhelming nearby city-states and starting to consume more and more territory. If you do nothing as a player, there will be too many fortresses popping up, too many city-states will be lost, and the world will succumb to this new force. But, if you take appropriate steps, you can tip the balance (like go on some special recon/sabotage missions) and allow these fortresses to be destroyed. <em>When</em> you're going to undertake these missions and <em>where</em>, it's up to you. If you are a high-standing member in some guild, and its HQ is in a city nearby some fortress, you might want to prioritize that. As the player can't be everywhere instantly, some mega-missions might affect <em>all</em> fortresses (think attack on a hive-mind)</p>
