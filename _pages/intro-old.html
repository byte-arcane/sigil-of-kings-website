<p>The below is a first stab at the intro. Every paragraph will be accompanied with a pan-and-zoom image.</p>
<p><strong><em>"Since the dawn of time, every few centuries, a species becomes sentient. The change is swift; the causes unknown. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The newly sentient race, in its transition to self-discovery, attempts to assert dominance to ensure its survival. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The result has always been a Great War, fought against the rest of the sentient species... Us. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Sages of our time have named this phenomenon as "Transcendence", and is regarded as the greatest mystery that we have ever known.</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>As the world is in conflict, heroes from every possible background have embarked in adventures to attempt to solve this mystery.</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>Many have died. Others were never seen again. </em></strong><br />
<strong><em>A few returned deranged, delirious, muttering about the coming of the time of Gods.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The mystery of Transcendence has always fascinated you, almost as much as adventuring.</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>When you became of age, you decided to pursue it. </em></strong><br />
<strong><em>Your destiny lies out there in the world, and beyond. Find the source of Transcendence"</em></strong></p>
